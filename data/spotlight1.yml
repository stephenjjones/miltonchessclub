title : "Weekly Homeschool Meetups at the Milton Library"
content: |
  We will be meeting this Fall at the Milton Library.  The meetup is geared towards elementary-age kids, but is open to all. Chess is a great activity for a wide age-range of kids to enjoy together. The organizer is a homeschool dad of two (4&1/2 year old and 6&1/2 year old). Contact <a href="mailto:stephen@miltonchessclub.com">stephen@miltonchessclub.com</a> for more information.
